<p>Dear 4diac community,
</p>

<p>We know that it has been a while since our last release, but we want to let you know that we have been busy making a lot of changes behind the scenes. 
We plan to release a new version later this year, packed with a wide range of new features and improvements. 
We believe that you, our valued community, might not be aware of all the changes that have happened since then. 
To address this, we will be providing regular updates on our recent progress via our news page and social media. 
Our next release will include all the features that we have been working on, so stay tuned for more information.</p>

<p>
In addition to our upcoming release, we would also like to showcase research works that use or improve Eclipse 4diac. 
If you have been working on a project that involves Eclipse 4diac and would like us to consider featuring it, please send it with a short description of how Eclipse 4diac was affected or how it helped your work, depending on the nature of the project. 
We value community contributions and are always looking for ways to improve the 4diac ecosystem.</p>

<p>
If you have any suggestions for future updates or would like to share how you've used 4diac IDE in your work, please reach out to us through our mailing list or social media channels. 
We can't wait to hear from you! </p>
