<?php printNewsEntryHeader(__FILE__, "Sneak Preview: 4diac and OPC UA in Action"); ?>

<p>The <a href="https://ias.vdma.org/en/home">VDMA Integrated Assembly Solutions Group</a> is currently developing an OPC UA 
Companion Specification for smart mechatronic components. 
In order to show the potential and the applicability of this spec in action the group currently builds a demonstrator.</p>

<p>We are very proud that 4diac is part of this demonstration machine implementing the new interaction and coordination mechanism. 
See below a sneak preview on the machine consisting of roughly 30 smart mechatronic components. 
Several modules in this machine will be programmed and operated with 4diac.</p>

<p>Currently it is in the middle of its setup. You can see it live and in action at the 
automatica trade fair in Munich on 19th - 22nd June, 
<a href="https://automatica-munich.com/supporting-program/industry-4.0-demonstrators/opc-ua-demonstrator/index.html">hall B4, booth 332</a>.
</p>

<p>See you there,
	<br>The 4diac Team</p>
