<p>Dear 4diac community,
</p>

<p>
Two of our team members conducted usability studies over the past years on our automation solution development tool, the 4diac IDE. 
We're proud to announce that the results of these studies have been published in a well-regarded scientific journal, and we believe they will help us make the 4diac IDE even better.
</p>

<p>
As many of you know, developing industrial control software is a challenging task, especially when control systems are unique and need to be maintained for many years. 
That's why we put a lot of effort into making the 4diac IDE a more intuitive and efficient environment for creating automation solutions.</p>

<p>
Our research paper discusses the results of two usability studies we conducted to evaluate the 4diac IDE. 
We used the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human-computer interaction to assess the tool's capabilities, and we also conducted a user study with ten industrial automation engineers who used the 4diac IDE in a realistic control software maintenance scenario.</p>

<p>
Based on the lessons we learned from these studies, we were able to make improvements to the 4diac IDE that we believe will make it an even better tool for developing industrial control software. 
We encourage you to read our publication <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/assessing-the-usefulness-of-a-visual-programming-ide-for-large-s/24013160">here</a> to learn more about our research and the changes we've made to the 4diac IDE.</p>

<p>
We're committed to providing our users with the most usable and efficient environment for creating automation solutions. 
Thank you for being a part of the Eclipse 4diac community, and keep an eye out for more updates on our ongoing efforts to improve the 4diac IDE!</p>
