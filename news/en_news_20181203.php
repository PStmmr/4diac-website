<p>As you know the Eclipse 4diac team has a strong focus in increasing 4diac's usability and user experience. 
With the last releases we think we got better. But we know there is still a long road ahead of us.
</p> 

<p>For mastering that road we need your feedback!</p>

<p>We have currently a questionnaire running where you can easily tell us where 4diac sucks or what is missing:</p> 
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/hVivvJKgTbD9HciI3">Fill the 4diac IDE Evaluation Questionnaire</a></b></p>

<p>However if you think questionnaires suck we are also looking for participants in usability tests:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/ksfb2fat32zcx9zv">Register as Usability Tester!</a></b></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your support,
	<br>The 4diac Team</p>
