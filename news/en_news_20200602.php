<?php printNewsEntryHeader(__FILE__, "Eclipse 4diac Welcomes Google Summer of Code 2020 Student", "img/gsoc.svg"); ?>

<p>The Eclipse 4diac team is excited to announce that this year we again get the chance to work with a student in the 
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code program</a>: 
<a href="https://www.aut.bme.hu/en/Staff/bacsisandor">S&aacute;ndor B&aacute;csi</a>  will be working on setting up an infrastructure for checking the correctness of IEC 61499 models using 
<a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.ocl">Object Constraint Language (OCL)</a>. 
OCL can be a solution to find issues in IEC 61499 models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill. 
We hope that the work of S&aacute;ndor will give our users early feedback and with that improve the usability and user experience of 4diac IDE.</p>
 

<p>Details on the plan work, the milestones, and ideas what S&aacute;ndor wants to check can be found on the 
<a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_4diacWiki/Development/Detecting_Model_Inconsistencies_in_4diac_Models_with_OCL">project&apos;s wiki page</a>. 
As always feedback and support is warmly welcome.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to work together with S&aacute;ndor on this interesting problem over this summer.</p>
