<p>On 15th September, the open platform automation forum was held at <a href="http://www.ciif-expo.com/plus/list.php?tid=255">Shanghai Automation Fair 2020</a>. 
The open platform automation forum aimed at promoting open technologies such as IEC 61499 and OPC UA for industrial automation. 
Mr. Yao from Changzhou MaximLumen Ltd presented a Eclipse 4diac-based IEC 61499 solution for distributed control applications. 
Based on the 4diac IDE and 4diac FORTE runtime, they created a customized IEC 61499 runtime TinyForte that could be fit in small embedded devices. 
The IEC 61499 standard provides great support for innovation from medium and small industrial vendors.
<p>Cheers,</p>
