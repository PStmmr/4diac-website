<?php printNewsEntryHeader(__FILE__, "Eclipse 4diac Project Graduation", "img/uws.png"); ?>

<p>We are happy to announce that the Eclipse 4diac passed the graduation review today. 
This is a major step for the project and its community. 
We could show that we are working as open source project following the Eclipse development process. 
It also means that we are leaving the incubation phase.</p>

<p>Thanks to the great 4diac community for making this possible.</p>
