<p>Hi!</p>
<p>During the past year, 4diac IDE has kept me increasingly busy in my work and private life.
I got to know the 4diac community - especially during the last 4days of 4diac - and the development process.</p> 

<p>My main focus is currently on improving the usability of the IDE. 
This greatly improves the learnability of the tool, while also increasing the development speed of experienced developers.
Furthermore, I am involved in teaching IEC 61499 and Eclipse 4diac at university.</p>

<p>Today, I am excited and honored to announce that I got promoted to committer status.
In addition to my own developments, I will now increasingly review code submitted by other contributors.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Bianca Wiesmayr</p><br>
