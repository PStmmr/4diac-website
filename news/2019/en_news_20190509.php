<p>It is a great pleasure for me that this year we got a student project sponsored in the Google Summer of Code. 
Jan Holzweber will work on our <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4571690556719104">Lua-based dynamic code loading infrastructure</a> and turn it from experimental prototype into a usable stable feature. 

<p>Please give Jan a warm welcome and your support.

<p>Iâ€™m looking forward to work as mentor with him.</p>

<p>Cheers,
	<br>Alois</p>
