<p>Here is a new update on my GSoC project. 
We have now finished the first phase and i already started to fix the first bugs. 
Deploying FBs with very basic functionality should now work again from the <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=547888">development branch</a>. 
The next step is to find the causes, why certain functionality is not working properly. 
Therefore, i created a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=548765">new list of bugs</a> as roadmap we are going to do. 
You can find more detailed information in the <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_4diacWiki/Development/Dynamic_Type_Loader">eclipse wiki</a>
</p>

<p>Cheers,
	<br>Jan</p>
