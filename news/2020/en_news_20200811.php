<p>Hey All!</p>
<p>Here is a new update on my GSoC project. 
I am excited to announce that I have finished the implementation of the first set of OCL constraints. 
It is now possible to give 4diac users early feedback on the validation errors at the ECC level and at the Application level. 
The list of constraints can be found  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFpQhYCTBrei3QrgTYtS0RLJ0daLuESjP0bE87VRZas/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. 
The validation messages (error, warnings and infos) are displayed in the Problems View (see screenshot below). 
The last step of this project is to complete the implementation of the remaining constraints and improve the infrastructure around OCL. 
As always feedback and support are warmly welcome.

<p>Cheers,
	<br>S&aacute;ndor</p>
