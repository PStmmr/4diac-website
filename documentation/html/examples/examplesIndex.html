<h1 id="topOfPage">4DIAC examples</h1>

<p>This page is intended to serve as index for 4DIAC examples that help understand and develop applications. If you want to contribute, you're welcome to do it by posting in the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=308" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="noHardwareRequired">General examples</h2>

<p>For the following examples, you don't need any special hardware:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="../../html/examples/xplus3.html">X+3</a>: This example uses 2 devices, 1 running FORTE and the other running FBRT. It has a really simple logic that allows the user to interact by inputing a number that's sent to FORTE, which add 3 to the input and returns the result which is shown back to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardwareRequired">Specific hardware required examples</h2>

<p>For the following examples, you'll need specific hardware to try them:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="../../html/examples/pidMotor.html">PID control on Lego Mindstorm Motor</a>: This example uses the Lego Mindstorm EV3. It creates a Basic Function Block that implements a PID control on the position of a motor.</li>
    <li><a href="../../html/examples/bbbTraficControl.html">Traffic control example running on a Beagle Bone Black</a>: This is the Traffic Control that comes with 4DIAC, but instead of running locally, the control runs on a BBB and the HMI locally. This example is important because it finds many networking issues that are solved.</li>
</ul>
