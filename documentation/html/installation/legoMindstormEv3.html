<h1>Using 4DIAC with a Lego Mindstorm EV3</h1>

  <h2 id="ev3_introduction">About the Lego Mindstorm EV3 and ev3dev</h2>
  
	<p>Lego Mindstorm is a series of kits from Lego whose flexibility
		allows the construction of different system which can be controlled
		and sensed by the user, using the inputs and outputs. This document
		focuses on how to implement FORTE in the specific model Lego Mindstorm
		EV3(LMSEV3). To know more about the LMSEV3 you can visit its Wikipedia
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3">page</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The LMSEV3 comes with its own software, but work have been done to
		implement a Linux distribution that can run on it. The ev3dev is a
		Debian Linux-based operating system that can run in the LMSEV3. More
		information about capabilities of ev3dev can be found in its <a
			href="http://www.ev3dev.org/">website</a>. The procedure to make
		ev3dev run in a LMSEV3 is similar to how it's done when running a
		Linux operating system in a Raspberry Pi. The best and faster way to
		implement ev3dev in a LMSEV3 is following the instruction on its <a
			href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/">getting
			started page</a>. Basically what must be done is to download the ev3dev
		image and write it on a mini SD card (yes, without an mini SD card you
		won't be able to run it), insert it in the LMSEV3 and boot it. You'll
		have to set the network configuration to connect to it.
	</p>

	<p>So, what will you find in this special Linux version for LMSEV3?
		First, you'll find a menu in the screen of the LMSEV3 that can be
		accessed using the buttons. And second, you will be able to connect
		using SSH the same way you would do it on a Raspberry Pi, the
		BeagleBone Black or other Linux-based operating system and go through
		the folder system of the ev3dev that is prepared for the LMSEV3. To
		access all the I/O of the LMSEV3 (including the buttons, led and the
		screen) there are specific explanations in <a href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/">this</a>
		ev3dev webpage, but FORTE takes care of accessing them and you as user
		will only work with normal I/O Function Blocks as IX, QX, IW, QW and so on. 
	</p>

	<p>
		With the LMSEV3 running the ev3dev and accessible through SSH, the
		next thing to do is to install and run FORTE in it. Similar to other
		platforms, you have two possibilities. The first one is to transfer
		the source code to the ev3dev (using <a
			href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> in Windows or
		the "scp" command in Linux), installing the compiler and other
		necessary tools (c++ compiler and CMake, mainly) and compiling it
		directly in the LMSEV3. The second option is to use a cross-compiler.
		This means that you will code and compile in your desktop machine, and
		then send the executable to the LMSEV3 and run on it. The first option
		is easier to implement but is slower to compile. The second one, is
		much faster but the setup of the environment in your desktop machine
		is difficult and takes time. If you are compiling just once or just to
		try it, use the first option. If you will be compiling several times,
		you should try the second option. As said, getting your desktop
		machine to cross-compile for the ev3dev is not easy, but a complete step-by-step guide is presented
		<a
			href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/using-brickstrap-to-cross-compile/">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>To install the the necessary tools to compile in the ev3dev run the following commands:</p>
	<div class="code">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake</div>

	<p>This will install the necessary tools. Then, you just need to go to the
	FORTE folder you transfered, and execute: </p>
	 
	 <div class="code">. setup_posix.sh</div>

	<p>which is going to setup everyting in the bin/posix folder. Next,
		you should go into the bin/posix folder and simply execute "make" to
		start the compilation.</p>

	<p>
		Remember, when you create your own FB, you should add these to the
		FORTE folder, adjust the CMakefiles.txt and compile again. In the <a
			href="#ev3_example">example</a> section, it is explained how to do
		this.
	</p>

	<h2 id="ev3_parameters">Parameters for the ev3Dev interface</h2>

	<p>This section is a reference of the parameters that can be used
		in FORTE to access the I/O of the LMSEV3. Reading this section
		carefully without using them could be quite boring and even useless,
		because the details will be forgotten if not used. We recommend to
		give a quick reading in order to know what can be accessed using
		FORTE. The next <a href="#ev3_example">section</a> presents an example of controlling a motor
		using a PID controller.</p>

	<h3 id="ev3_standard_parameters">Standard access</h3>

	<h4>Transparent access</h4>

	<p>The standard access refers to the access through well defined IO
		blocks, that allow transparency in the access of I/O in different
		platforms. Each block supports different parameters in the PARAM
		input, which defines the I/O of the system that will be accessed. The
		blocks used to control the I/O are named with two capital letters.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>The first letter indicates the direction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Q: output</li>
				<li>I: input</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The second letter indicates the size of it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>X: boolean</li>
				<li>W: Word (16 bits)</li>
				<li>D: Double (32 bits)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>So, for example a boolean input is read using the functional
		block IX. The output word, for example the PWM value of a motor is
		controlled with a QW block. Not all sizes are implemented in all
		platforms.</p>

	<h4>Parameters for the EV3</h4>

	<p>The parameters for the EV3 were designed for general use, and
		extension of them is easy to achieve. The format of the parameters
		follow 2 important rules:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>The only capital letters allowed are the A,B,C,D when used to
				define the output ports of the EV3 (outA, outB, outC, outD).</p>
		</li>

		<li><p>The parameters are given in three parts separated by
				points:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>port.typeOfIO.specific</p></li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li><p>port</p>

					<p>The first part of the parameter specifies the port of the
						Input or Output. For the EV3, the possible values are [in1 | in2 |
						in3 | in4 | outA | outB | outC | outD | emb]. The first eight are
						directly related to the actual ports of the EV3. The 'emb' port
						refers to anything that can be managed in the EV3 but not in the
						I/O ports, until now the leds and buttons, but in the future the
						screen and speaker would also be reference with the 'emb' port.</p></li>

				<li><p>typeOfIO</p>

					<p>The second part, specifies what is actually connected to the
						specified port. The possible values are [sensor | sensorw | button
						| led | motor]. The difference between 'sensor' and 'sensorw' is
						that 'sensor' is used for boolean sensors, and 'sensorw' for
						sensors which values are words (16 bits). The 'led' and 'button'
						are used to control the embedded leds and buttons of the EV3.
						'motor' is used for connected motors in any of the outputs.</p>

					<p>It must be clear that not all of the types can be used with
						any port. For example a led is only an output, so if used with a
						input, for example IX it won't intialize. Also, if used to control
						as a word QW, it won't initialize either.</p></li>

				<li><p>specific</p>

					<p>As its name says, this third parameter has no general form,
						and can also be formed of other several parameters separated by
						points(as in case of the led). Depending of the second parameter,
						the allowed values for this one are different, and it will be seen
						in the follow section.</p></li>
			</ol></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Specific parameters</h4>

	<p>For each possible typeOfIO, the list of possible specific part
		of the parameters are presented, followed by the limitations and
		examples.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>led (output only):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>right.red</li>
				<li>right.green</li>
				<li>left.red</li>
				<li>left.green</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Each specific is used to control each one of the four leds
				available. The orange led doesn't exist, but is the sum of red +
				green, so in order to turn on an orange light of the left for
				example, both the green and red of the left must be turned on.</p>

			<p>Limitation: 'led' must be used with QX and with the 'emb'
				port.</p>

			<p>Example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.led.right.red</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>button (input only):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>up</li>
				<li>down</li>
				<li>left</li>
				<li>right</li>
				<li>enter</li>
				<li>backspace</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Reads the buttons of the EV3.</p>

			<p>Limitation: 'button' must be used with IX and with the 'emb'
				port.</p>

			<p>Example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.button.enter</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>sensorw:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>[0-N] (input only)</li>
				<li>mode (input or output)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The sensorw is used with sensors that read a word value instead of a
				boolean and normally are more complex than regular touch sensors
				(boolean). Each sensor specifies how it retrieves the data, how many
				values and the format of it. Specifications of the supported sensors
				by the ev3dev are listed <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>Each one of the sensors' values is stored in a different file
				in the EV3. The specific [0-N] determines which file it is. For
				example the GYRO sensor can show the angle and the rotation speed.
				The values are store in value0 and value1 files, so to access just
				the rotation speed, the '1' specific must be used. The actual value
				must be checked in the link above.</p>

			<p>The 'mode' specific is used to change the mode of the sensor
				according to its specification. As an input, mode will retrieve the
				mode in which the sensor is working, and as output, the mode will be
				changed. The mode are mirrored using a 0 index according to the
				specification of the sensor.</p>

			<p>Limitation: sensorw cannot be used with boolean blocks (QX or
				IX). It must be used with an in[1-4] port, but is not restricted to
				input or output blocks when the specific "mode" is used.</p>

			<p>Limitation: the specific [0-N] can be used only as input, and
				the number shouldn't be greater than the allowed by the sensor in
				the mode that's working at the moment of initialization.</p>

			<p>Examples:</p>

			<p>
				Let's see an example of using the GYRO sensor specified <a
					target="_blank"
					href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/lego-ev3-gyro-sensor/">here</a>.
				The GYRO works in GYRO-ANG by default, showing only one value, then
				the only possible parameter is:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.0 (IW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>If a 1 instead of a 0 were used, the initialization would have
				failed.</p>

			<p>If the mode of the sensor wants to be retrieve, the "mode"
				specific should be used with the input IW.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.mode (IW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Because the GYRO sensor by default is in GYRO-ANG and GYRO-ANG
				is the first of the list according to the link above, the FB will
				read a 0 (0-index from the list in the link).</p>

			<p>If then the sensor's mode is changed using a QW with "mode"
				specific</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.mode (QW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>and writing a value 3 (0-index mode), the sensor's mode will
				change to GYRO-G&amp;A wich shows 2 values, angle and rotation
				speed. After changing the mode, two IW blocks with parameters</p>

			<ul>
				<li>in1.sensorw.0 (IW)</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>in1.sensorw.1 (IW)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>will retrieve the both values.</p>

			<p>ATTENTION!!! To get the rotation speed, the block with
				parameter "in1.sensorw.1" must be initialized AFTER the mode has
				been changed, because before changing the mode, the file for the
				rotation speed doesn't exist in the system and cannot be read.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>sensor (input only):</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[0-N]</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Used to control touch sensor (binary). sensor' specific is a
				subset of sensorw' specific. It doesn't allow mode, and even though
				the value is always stored in '0', the '0' specific must be used for
				two mainly reasons: 1. To have a standarized way of showing the
				parameters, and 2. to avoid problems in the future where a new
				sensor is stored in '1' instead of '0'.</p>

			<p>Limitations: 'sensor' must be used with QX and with an in[1-4]
				port.</p>

			<p>Example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in2.sensor.0</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>motor</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enable (output boolean only)</li>
				<li>reset (output boolean only)</li>
				<li>stop (output word only)</li>
				<li>pwm (input word or output word only)</li>
				<li>position (input or output double word only)</li>
				<li>speed (input word only)</li>
				<li>rot (input word only)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The 'enable' controls the state of the motor accroding to the
				OUT input of QX. A TRUE value turns ON the motor and a FALSE value
				turns it OFF. It must be used with QX.</p>

			<p>The 'reset' zeroes the position, pwm and speed values, and
				turn off the motor with a TRUE value in OUT. A FALSE value in OUT
				has no effect. It must be used with QX</p>

			<p>The 'stop' specific must not be confused with stoping the
				motor, because it specifies the way the motor behaves when PWM is
				zero according to the value written to OUT. It must be used with QW
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>0: [coast]: Removes power from the motor. The motor will
					freely coast to a stop.</li>

				<li>1: [brake]: Removes power from the motor and creates a
					passive electrical load. This is usually done by shorting the motor
					terminals together. This load will absorb the energy from the
					rotation of the motors and cause the motor to stop more quickly
					than coasting.</li>

				<li>3: [hold]: Causes the motor to actively try to hold the
					current position. If an external force tries to turn the motor, the
					motor will "push back" to maintain its position.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The 'pwm' reads the current pwm when using with IW of the
				motor or writes the desired pwm for the motor when using with QW.</p>

			<p>The 'position' reads the current position of the motor. In how
				many steps a rotation is divided, can be read from using the 'rot'
				specific. It must be used with ID. The position can be written, wich
				sets the position to the desired value.</p>

			<p>The 'speed' reads the current speed in positions by second. It
				must be used with IW.</p>

			<p>The 'rot' reads the motor specication of how many steps are in
				one turn of the motor. This can be read from the specifications of
				the motor normally and it's not necessary to add the block in an
				application just to read this information. It must be used with IW.</p>

			<p>Limitations: Event though each specific has its limitation
				regarding the type of block to use with, the typeOfIO "motor" must
				be used with one of the outputs of the EV3 out[A-B]</p>

			<p>Examples:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.enable (QX)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.pwm (QW writes the desired pwm, IW reads
						the actual pwm)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.position (ID)</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3 id="ev3_cheatsheet">I/O cheatsheet</h3>

	<p>This section doesn't add any new information, but summarize
		which parameters and FB should be used with each I/O.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Touch sensor connected to an input port. It must be used with
				IX</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in[X].sensor.[Y]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>where X is the number of the input in the EV3 (1-4) and Y is
				the value number where to read from according to the sensor. Read
				the specification of the sensor to be sure. Start trying from 0 if
				no information is available.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>One of the 6 buttons of the EV3. It must be used with IX</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.button.[up | down | left | right | enter |
						backspace]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Only one of the inputs can be selected for each IX.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Led of the EV3. It must be used with QX.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.led.[right | left].[red | green]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The orange led does not exist, but is the sum of green + red.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Motor connected to an output port. The FB to use depends on
				the parameter of the motor that wants to be handled.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Turn ON/OFF the motor. It must be used with QX.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.enable</p></li>

						FALSE value turns the motor OFF.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Reset the motor variables and stop. It must be used with QX.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.reset</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>Where X is the output capital letter of the EV3 (A-D, in

					</ul>

					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).

	<h2 id="ev3_example">Example: Implement a PID controller for the position of a motor of the
		EV3</h2>

	<p>In this tutorial, an implementation of a PID controller for a
		motor of the EV3 is presented. The position of the motor will be
		controlled using PWM. The implementation shows all the steps from
		creating a PID Functional Block in 4DIAC, up to tuning the PID
		controller and printing the values in a graph.</p>

	<p>A basic usage knowledge of 4DIAC is necessary to follow through
		the steps.</p>

	<h3>Creating the PID FB</h3>

	<p>The first thing to do is to create the PID functional block. Go
		to File->New->New type. In the pop-up menu, choose the parent folder
		to store the new FB, choose PID as the Type name, and select Basic.fbt
		as Type. Click Finish, and the view to edit the new FB will open.

		First, the interface must be configured. Use the image below to
		complete it</p>

	<p>The interfaces uses Kp, Ki and Kd as constants to be tuned
		instead of the times Ti and Td. This allow easily to zero the integral
		part. The interval is the time between requests to the FB and is
		expected to be constant.</p>

	<p>With the interface set, the next step is to define the ECC and
		the algorithm. The ECC graphic is really simple, and it looks like the
		image below. You may have to create the new algorithms with the names
		shown before filling the graph.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDECC.png" alt="Interface of the PID FB" />

	<p>With the ECC graph ready, it is time to write the code that will
		rule the behavior of the FB. In the Properties tab below the ECC
		graph, in one of the sides-tabs called "All InternalVars" add two
		variables of type REAL, called LAST_ERROR and INTEGRATION_ACCUM. These
		variables are part of the FB and retain their values between events.</p>

	<p>Next, we will edit the algorithms specified in the ECC graph.
		The simple RESET algorithm just initialize the internal variables. The
		code for RESET is as following:</p>
	<div class="code">
		<code>LAST_ERROR := 0.0; INTEGRATION_ACCUM := 0.0;</code>
	</div>

	<p>The REQ algorithm is the following, but since is more complex,
		it will be explained in parts.</p>

	<div class="code"><code>VAR
  proportionalPart: REAL;
  integralPart: REAL;
  derivativePart: REAL;
  Ydesired: REAL;
  errorFiltered: REAL;
END_VAR;

  IF ABS(InError) <= Noise THEN
    errorFiltered := 0;
  ELSE
    errorFiltered := InError;
  END_IF;
  (* calculate proportional part *)
  proportionalPart := Kp * errorFiltered;
  
  (* run integrator *)
  integralPart := errorFiltered * Interval * Ki  + INTEGRATION_ACCUM;
    
  (* run derivative*)
    
  derivativePart := (errorFiltered - LAST_ERROR) * Kd / Interval;
  
  LAST_ERROR := errorFiltered;
    
  (* calculate output Y *)
  Ydesired := proportionalPart + integralPart + derivativePart; 
    
  (* check output for limits *)
  IF Ydesired >= LIM_H THEN
    Y := LIM_H;
    IF Ki <> 0.0 THEN
      IF (errorFiltered < 0 AND Kp > 0) OR (errorFiltered > 0 AND Kp < 0) THEN
        INTEGRATION_ACCUM := integralPart;
      END_IF;
    ELSE
      INTEGRATION_ACCUM := 0.0;
    END_IF;
    LIM := TRUE;
  ELSIF Ydesired <= LIM_L THEN
    Y := LIM_L;
    IF Ki <> 0.0 THEN
      IF (errorFiltered > 0 AND Kp > 0) OR (errorFiltered < 0 AND Kp < 0)THEN
        INTEGRATION_ACCUM := integralPart;
      END_IF;
    ELSE
      INTEGRATION_ACCUM := 0.0;
    END_IF;
    LIM := TRUE;
  ELSE
    Y := Ydesired;
    INTEGRATION_ACCUM := integralPart;
    LIM := FALSE;
  END_IF; 
</code></div>
      <p>The part between VAR and END_VAR is the declaration of the local variables that will be used inside this algorithm. The values are not retained between events.</p>
      
      <p>The first IF statement </p>
      <div class="code"><code>IF ABS(InError) <= Noise THEN
  errorFiltered := 0;
ELSE
  errorFiltered := InError;
END_IF;</code></div>
      
      <p>is to turn off the PID when the value of the error is below the Noise specified in the input. Only when the error is bigger than the Noise threshold, the computation of the PID will be done.</p>
      
      <p>The next part is the core of the PID computation. All the values are stored in local variables before mirroring then to the actual outputs and internal variables.</p>
      
      <div class="code"><code>(* calculate proportional part *)
proportionalPart := Kp * errorFiltered;
  
(* run integrator *)
integralPart := errorFiltered * Interval * Ki  + INTEGRATION_ACCUM;
    
(* run derivative*)
derivativePart := (errorFiltered - LAST_ERROR) * Kd / Interval;
  
LAST_ERROR := errorFiltered;
    
(* calculate output Y *)
Ydesired := proportionalPart + integralPart + derivativePart;</code></div>
      
      <p>The last part is really important, because it limits the output and eliminates the integral windup. Because the motor PWM can havae values between -100 and 100, if the output is outside this range, the PID should limit this value. More information about integration windup can be found in the internet, but basically, when the error is too big, the integration part doesn't work as ideally suppossed and insert unexpected behavior to the controller. </p>
      
      <div class="code"><code>(* check output for limits *)
IF Ydesired >= LIM_H THEN
  Y := LIM_H;
  IF Ki <> 0.0 THEN
    IF (errorFiltered < 0 AND Kp > 0) OR (errorFiltered > 0 AND Kp < 0) THEN
      INTEGRATION_ACCUM := integralPart;
    END_IF;
  ELSE

	<p>
		The IF and ELSEIF are the limits of the value, and in the ELSE is
		where allowed values are processed. The output limitation is
		straightforward, but the windup solution can be confusing. What is
		done is to activate the integration part only when the desired output
		is inside the limits (in the ELSE), OR when it is outside the limits
		AND the error is forcing the way back inside the limits. The source of
		information about this can be found <a target="_blank"

	</p>

	<p>Whit the algorithms done, the FB is ready to be exported and
		compiled with FORTE.</p>

	<h3>Exporting and compiling with FORTE for the Ev3</h3>

	<p>Once the FB is ready, go to File->Export... and select
		4DIAC->4DIAC Type Export. Then explore the folder tree on the left and
		select the PID FB created on the right. Choose where to export and
		then click Finish.</p>

	<p>To get the source code ready to compile FORTE with the created
		FB, the generated .cpp and .h files have to be added to the CMAKE
		configuration. The easiest way to do it is to put both files in the
		folder src/modules/lms_ev3 and add to the CMakeLists.txt file in that
		folder, the following line at the end.</p>

	<div class="code">forte_add_sourcefile_hcpp(PID)</div>

	<p>
		The next thing to do is to compile FORTE for the EV3. The easiest way
		to do it is to copy all the code to the EV3, get the compiling tools
		inside the EV3 and compile it. The process is really slow compared if
		it is done in a normal computer, but for one time is much faster than
		setting all the cross-compiling environment explained <a
			target="_blank"
			href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/using-brickstrap-to-cross-compile/">here.</a>
		More details are presented in the <a href="#ev3_introduction">section</a> above.
	</p>

	<h3>Creating the PID Application in 4DIAC</h3>

	<p>After FORTE with the PID can run in the EV3, is time to create
		the application that will run on it to contorl the motor's position,
		and store the values. The application will be shown in parts, for a
		better understanding.</p>

	<h4>ON/OFF the controller</h4>

	<p>The first part of the application can be made in different ways,
		which allows a better control of the tests. In this example, it
		consists of two push buttons connected to in2 and in4, one for
		starting the motor and PID and the other one to reset all parameters
		(which also stops the motor). It has a cycle to read both buttons
		waiting for a rising trigger on them which sends the event to the
		enable or reset of the motor.</p>

	<p>The initialization of the StartButton FB is done from the COLD
		START FB when configuring the system.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDButtonPart.png"
		alt="Button part of the PID application" />

	<h4>Reading the system</h4>

	<p>This part begins with a cycle block that outputs an event every
		100ms, that will triger the PID computation. The cycle starts when the
		motor is enabled, and stops when the motor is reset. This cycle,
		triggers the reading of the system, in this case the position of the
		motor. This position is read as WORD (it should be a double, actually,
		but for now, it can be limited to a WORD) and then is converted to an
		INT that allows negative values (the WORD_TO_INT block was updated to
		allow negative values), and then to REAL in order to compute the
		difference to the set point stablished by the user (INT#1000 in the
		example). The F_SUB block expect REAL values, and in the input IN1,
		the set point is given. Take a look that at the output of the
		WORD_TO_INT block, there is another conversion to a STRING, this
		conversion is sent to the PC to store the values of the position to
		plot it. In the last part, it will be shown how is it done.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDReadingPart.png"
		alt="Reading part of the PID application" />

	<h4>Input of the PID controller</h4>

	<p>This part takes the error as the difference of the set point and
		the position read from the motor, and sends it to the PID controller.
		The rest of the inputs of it are user defined. The gains (Kp, Ki, and
		Kd) are tuned according to the method. In this example, the
		Zeigler-Nichols was used, and it will be seen later. The interval is
		0.1 that corresponds to the 100ms of the PID Cycle. The limits
		corresponds to the limit values of the output, in this case the PWM of
		the motor.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDInPIDPart.png" alt="Input of PID" />

	<h4>Output of the PID controller</h4>

	<p>The last part corresponds to the output of the PID controller
		and the sending of the information the a log in a PC. The output of
		the PID is converted to INT and then to WORD to write then the output
		to the PWM of the motor. Also, the INT value is converted to STRING,
		similar to the position in the input part, and once both conversions
		(position and output) are done, they are written to a file using the
		CSV_WRITER_2 FB from the UTILS module. This FB allows to write 2
		values (SD_1 and SD_2) as CSV. The block is in other color, because is
		in another device, not in the EV3.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDOutputPart.png" alt="Output of PID" />

	<h4>Configuring the system</h4>

	<p>Now that the application is done, some other configurations are
		needed in the system. The first thing is to create both devices and
		connect them using the Ethernet segment. In the EV3 resource, the
		first thing to do is to connect the COLD START to the initialization
		of the StartButton as said before.</p>

	<p>The other configuration in the EV3 resource is the publishing of
		the conversions of the position and output of the PID. Using a
		PUBLISH_2_0 with both input and the multicast UDP ID (in this case,
		239.192.0.2:65000), and the REQ triggerred by the E_REND FB from the
		application. With this, the EV3 will send the position and output of
		the PID to the ID address everytime both conversion are done.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDPublish.png" alt="Publishing the data to the PC" />

	<p>The configuration of the resource of the PC where the data will
		be stored, consists of a SUBSCRIBE_2 FB that will receive the
		information published by the EV3. The ID is the same as the publisher,
		and the outputs are converted using the STRING2STRING because the
		output is an ANY type. When both conversion are done, they are written
		in the file. Take in account that the CSV_WRITER FB doesn't flush
		inmediately the output, so the FORTE application must exit to read the
		information in the file.</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDSubscribe.png" alt="Subscribe to data from EV3" />

	<p>
		NOTE: In windows machines, the used multicast address is not always
		detected and the packets from the EV3 don't arrive to the FORTE
		application in the PC. This happens often if the PC is connected to
		the EV3 through an ad-hoc connection. To overcome this, try adding the
		address route with gateway to your own machine in the as presented in
		the Troubleshooting part at the bottom of the <a target="_blank"

			example</a>
	</p>

	<h3>Tuning the PID</h3>

	<p>
		With the application ready and working, it is presented now the <a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method">Ziegler-Nichols
			method</a> to tune the PID. The basic idea is to turn off the integral
		and derivative parts, and increase Kp until the output has stable and
		constant oscillations. The value of Kp that produces this output is
		called Ku and the oscillation's period at this Ku is called Tu. With
		these two values, the values of the Kp, Ki, and Kd are chosen
		according to the table of the link before. Remember that Kd = Kp/Ti
		and Ki = Kp*Td.
	</p>

	<p>The set point is the position 1000. The first value of Kp is 1
		and produces a non oscillating result. With Kp = 2, it takes longer,
		but still without stable oscillations. With Kp = 3, the results show a
		stable oscillation. So, the critical Ku value must be between 2 and 3.
		After a binary search between 2 and 3, it is found that Ku = 2.18 and
		its graph is shown also below. From the data, it can be seen that the
		oscillations have a period of 600ms (0.6s).</p>

	<img src="./img/PIDKp.png" alt="Graphs of testing Kp" />

	<p>With the values of Ku and Tu, it is computed the values of Kp,
		Ki and Kd for the PID controller from the table. The values are Kp =
		1.308, Ki = 4.36 and Kd = 0.0981. With this values, the PID controller
		is again tested and the result is as follow:</p>
