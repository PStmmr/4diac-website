<h2>Get C/C++ support for Eclipse</h2>
<ol>
	<li>If you do not already use Eclipse to run 4DIAC-IDE from source, download the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse for C/C++ Developers</a> and unzip the file to a suitable location (e.g., <span class="folderLocation">c:\eclipse</span>). Otherwise you can integrate C/C++ functionality into your existing Eclipse by <span class="menu4diac">Help &rarr; Install New Software</span>, choosing your Eclipse version (1) and checking <span class="menu4diac">Programming Languages &rarr; C/C++ Development Tools</span> (2).
	<div><img src="./img/eclipseInstallNewSoftware.png" alt="Install new software in Eclipse"/></div></li>
		
	
	<li>Restart <span class="fileLocation">eclipse.exe</span></li>
	<li>Choose a workspace directory. This will be the directory where your C/C++ projects will be located. It is recommended to set the workspace folder one level above the entire source code folder. Please avoid any spaces in its names. Otherwise you might get problems when compiling FORTE.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Compile FORTE with Eclipse</h2>
<p>For using Eclipse you must have chosen the rigth project in step 2 in <a href="./install.html#generateFilesForCompiling">Generate files for compiling</a>.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Import FORTE by <span class="menu4diac">File &rarr; Import... &rarr; General &rarr; Existing Project into Workspace</span>. In case your Workspace is one folder above your source code folder you only have to click on <span class="button4diac">Browse...</span> and <span class="button4diac">OK</span> afterwards to import FORTE into Eclipse. Otherwise select the directory where you have extracted your FORTE and check <span class="menu4diac">Copy into workspace</span> (otherwise the source will stay at the original place).</li>
	<li>Start Make Targets View by <span class="menu4diac">Window &rarr; Show View &rarr; Build Targets</span> if it is not open already. Double click the makefile: <span class="fileLocation">bin/[YOUR_SYSTEM]/all</span> to compile FORTE to a executable application. If you don't see the targets (all or clean), you can create them in the same window. Make sure that you create them in the right folder.

</ol>

<h2>Debug FORTE with Eclipse</h2>
<p>For the debugging of self developed Function Blocks run through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set a breakpoint in the source code file of the desired Function Block.</li>
	<li>Go to <span class="menu4diac">Run &rarr; Debug Configurations...</span></li>
	<li>Right click on <span class="menu4diac">C/C++ Application &rarr; New</span>. In the <span class="tab4diac">Main</span> tab, you should fill the <span class="specificText">C/C++ Application:</span> with the binary file you generated (normally <span class="folderLocation">FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/[YOUR_SYSTEM]/src/forte[.exe]</span>). In the <span class="tab4diac">Debugger</span> tab, choose your desired debugger. In Windows you normally use Cygwin or MinGW (you have to install them in order for them to appear in the selection box).
	<div><img src="./img/eclipseLaunchDebug.png" alt="Eclipse Launch Debug Configuration Selection"></div></li>
		
	<li>Click <span class="button4diac">Debug</span></li>
	<li>Confirm for changing into the Debug view</li>
	<li>In case you don't see the file where the debugger stopped at the beggining, press the <span class="button4diac">Locate File</span> button (1) and navigate to the Eclipse workspace which contains the extracted FORTE, type <span class="specificText">main</span> into the search field of the Windows Explorer and select the offered <span class="fileLocation">main.cpp</span>. FORTE is now stopped at the <span class="specificText">main()</span> function.
	<div><img src="./img/eclipseDebug.png" alt="Eclipse C++ Debug View"></div></li>
		

	<li>Press the <span class="button4diac">Resume</span> button (2) to run FORTE and observe the behavior of our application.</li>
	<li>Always press the <span class="button4diac">Terminate</span> button for stopping a FORTE launched within Eclipse. This avoids FORTE running in the background (not always shown in Task Manager).</li>
</ol>
