<h1 id="topOfPage">Setting up Mingw for FORTE Development</h1>

<h2>Install <a href="http://www.mingw-w64.org/" target="_blank">Mingw-w64</a></h2>
<p>Download the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/" target="_blank">Mingw-w64 Installer</a>. Install the version you like and specify "win32" as thread if requested.</p>

<p>After installing, press <span class="button4diac">Windows Key + Pause</span>. In the System window, click <span class="button4diac">Advanced System Settings &rarr; Advanced (tab) &rarr; Environment Variables</span>. Change PATH variable (click on it), and add the path where your MinGW binaries have been installed in e.g., <span class="folderLocation">C:\MinGW\bin\</span>. Add <span class="folderLocation">C:\mingw-w64\XXXXX\ming[32-64]\bin</span> in the Windows PATH variable.</p> 

<h2>Test Mingw-w64</h2>
<p>Open command prompt window by pressing <span class="button4diac">Windows</span> button and entering <span class="inlineCode">cmd</span>. Enter <span class="inlineCode">g++ --version</span>, and if you can see some information about the version of the compiler, it was susscesfull. If you get an error like "Command g++ not found", then you must have done something wrong.</p>

<h2>Change name of the make executable</h2>

<p>In your installation folder, inside the <span class="folderLocation">bin</span> directory, you should find a file called <span class="fileLocation">mingw32-make.exe</span>. Copy this file in the same directory and change it to <span class="fileLocation">make.exe</span>. This is because this file is the one you will use to compile FORTE, and "make" is the command used throughout the documentation for it.</p>

<h2>CMake and Compilation</h2>

<p>In step 2 of <a href="./install.html#generateFilesForCompiling">Generate files for compiling</a>, 
you have to select <span class="specificText">Unix Makefiles</span>, <span class="specificText">MinGW Makefiles</span> when working with MinGW. 
The architecture option needs to be set to <span class="specificText">Win32</span>.</p>

<p>After generating in CMake, to compile forte, you do</p>
<div class="code">$ cd FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/[YOUR_SYSTEM]
$ make</div>

<h1 id="whereToGoFromHere">Where to go from here?</h1>

<p>Now that you installed the required tools, it's time to start using them. Take a look at the following page:</p>

<p><a href="../4diacIDE/overview.html">Step by step tutorial</a></p>

<p>If you want to compile FORTE for another platform or want to know more about that, here's a quick link back:</p>
