<h1>FAQ FORTE</h1>

<a name="faq1"></a>
<h2>Windows/Cygwin: The setup script runs to completion but when building the target I get strange compile errors</h2>
<ul>
	<li>First check for any strange output of the setup script. Maybe your system misses something.</li>
	<li>Do you have spaces in the directory names where you have put your FORTE? Some Cygwin versions have problems with these.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CMake/Cygwin: Can not find C and C++ compilers</h2>
CMake Errors: 
<div class="code">your C compiler: CMAKE_C_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set CMAKE_C_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name. 
your CXX compiler: CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.</div>
<p>In this case you need to check the advanced check box and look for <span class="code">CMAKE_CXXX_COMPILER</span> and <span class="code">CMAKE_C_COMPILER</span> and set the path and executable for your C and C++ compiler. e.g., for Cygwin this could be <span class="code">c:\cygwin\bin\g++-3.exe</span> for the C++ compiler and <span class="code">c:\cygwin\bin\gcc-3.exe</span> for the C compiler.

<h2>CMake/Cygwin: Can not find RC Compilers</h2>
CMake Error: 
<div class="code">your RC compiler: CMAKE_RC_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set CMAKE_RC_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.</div>
<p>Again you need to check the advanced chekc box and look for <span class="code">CMAKE_RC_COMPILER</span>. For Cygwin or MinGW on Windows it needs a file called windres.exe (e.g., C:\cygwin\bin\windres.exe).

<h2>FORTE is C++ why are you than using the C-style include files for the standard c library instead of the C++ style include files?</h2>
<p>The main reason for this is that not all platforms provide the correct C++ include files. Especially with real-time OSs like eCos where you can freely configure the supported features. Using C++ style C include files on these platforms would pull lots of stuff from the compilers in and result in a bigger image or even worse it would not compile. So as of current experience C style include files are more reliable.</p>
