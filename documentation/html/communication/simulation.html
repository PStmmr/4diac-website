<h1 id="topOfPage">Communicating with Simulation Tools</h1>

<h2 id="matlab">Matlab</h2>

<p>4diac user Marc Jakobi developed a communicating library in Matlab, which allows connecting IEC 61499 control applications with simulation models in Matlab. The library, which is available as open source, implements the Client/Server protocol defined in the <a href="http://www.holobloc.com/doc/ita/index.htm" target="_blank">IEC 61499 compliance profile for feasibility demonstrations</a>. Therefore, on the 4diac side you just need to insert a server communication function block. For detailed documentation as well as the library code, please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/MrcJkb/tcpip4diac" target="_blank">tcpip4diac project on GitHub</a>.</p>
