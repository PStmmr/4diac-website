<h1 id= "ImportSystem">Import an Existing <i>System</i></h1>
<p>Existing <i>Systems</i> can be imported as follows: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Start 4DIAC-IDE with the desired Workspace</li>
	<li>select <i>File/Import/Existing Projects into Workspace</i> and press <i>Next</i></li>
	<li>choose the folder that contains the folder with the <i>System</i> you want to import</i>
	<li>mark the desired <i>System</i> within the project field below</li>
	<li>if your project is not already within your workspace and if you do not want to modify the original version of your projekt mark <i>Copy Projects into workspace</i> and press <i>Finish</i>. Consider that if you did not check <i>Copy Projects into workspace</i> and you delete your <i>System</i> within 4DIAC then your <i>System</i> will be deleted permanently.</li>

<h2 id= "ImportType">Import an Existing IEC 61499 <i>Types</i></h2>
	<p>New systems per default contain a copy the IEC 61499 types in the tool-library. If different types are need, for
    example from another project or another IEC 61499 engineering tool, these type files can be easily added by copying them into
    the project directory at the desired place. Furthermore the 
    <b>Type Navigator</b> allows to drag and drop types between projects as well as within a project to a different folder.</p>
    
<h1 id= "VirtualDNS">Virtual DNS Functionality</i></h1>
<p>The Properties View of the System Configuration Editor provides a <i>Virtual DNS</i> editor. This functionality allows defining a set of variables which are replaced by a specified value. The variable names can be used for parameters of Function Blocks and <i>Devices</i>. During the deployment, all variables which are available in the VirtualDNS are replaced with the specified value. For using a variable, the variable name has to be written between <span class="code">%</span>. </p>
